Couldn't agree more:



> People. 140-character messages. That’s Twitter.

So simple. So powerful. So fragile.

So leave it alone. We’re talking. Don’t interrupt.



But just rebuilding Twitter before it gets more "richer stories" and crammed by ads probably won't help: [We could build an open Twitter, but would anyone use it?](http://gigaom.com/2012/07/04/we-could-build-an-open-twitter-but-would-anyone-use-it/)
