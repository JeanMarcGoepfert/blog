A friend of mine asked me to craft an icon for his external hard drive case and I would like to share those with you too. These desktop icons show the the silver and black Icy Box external aluminium case with USB interface and are intended as a replacement for the generic external hard disk icon in Mac OS X Leopard.

As always these desktop icons are free for you personal and non-commercial use. All other usage of this copyrighted material [require my written permission](http://www.kremalicious.com/about/contact/).

The whole package includes 7 icons either packed in a nice tagged iContainer for use with Candybar or in Mac + Win + Linux compatible formats. If you have such an Icy Box case grab the icons [from my Goodies page.](http://www.kremalicious.com/goodies/#icons) Have fun!
