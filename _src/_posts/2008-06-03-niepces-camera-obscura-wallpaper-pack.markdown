In addition to my Niépce's Camera Obscura icons for Aperture and iPhoto I have made some Wallpapers containing both icons.

<!-- more -->

All Wallpapers are using a custom designed background which imitates the look of a metal plate like it was used in Niépce's experiments although it wasn't golden ;-) To make it more Mac style I have added a stenciled dots pattern (which is a commonly used reference to the front design of the MacPro). Here are the details:





  * Aperture and iPhoto styled Camera Obscura as it was used by Nicéphore Niépce.


  * Including one desktop version with the Aperture styled Camera Obscura and one with the iPhoto styled. Both come in 1920x1200 for widescreen displays and 1600x1200 for normal displays


  * Including 2 different crops for the iPhone (480x320).

  


Just grab them from the [Goodies page](/goodies/) and have fun.
