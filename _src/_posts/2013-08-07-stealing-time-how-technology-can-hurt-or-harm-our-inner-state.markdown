Wrote another post on the ezeep blog, awkwardly quoting me:

> The promise of modern technology has always been: use it and you’ll have more time for the important stuff in your life.  As it turned out, it’s quite the opposite. There’re a lot of socioeconomic reasons for this development but, to some degree, it’s caused by the way digital services today are designed from the very beginning. Those services are stealing time by design, tricking us into thinking the stuff we do on there is somehow important.
