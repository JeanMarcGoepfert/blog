> Thousands of people take photos every day. What if one of them seems odd? Terrorists use surveillance to help plan attacks, taking photos and making notes about security measures like the location of CCTV cameras. If you see someone doing that, we need to know. Let experienced officers decide what action to take.

yeah, i'm guilty. i took several photos of cctv cameras:
[At Agentur Ahron](http://www.agentur-ahron.de/bild_db/details.php?image_id=552)
[At Panthermedia](http://www.panthermedia.net/index2.php?page=image_preview.php&image=441619)

And there are more in my photo archive... Guess you have no other choice than informing the London cops cause they just "need to know".

You can find the campaign website of the london police here:

You will be surprised what other things they are afraid of...
